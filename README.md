# Bidirectional CuDNNLSTM Energy Disaggregator
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring, sometimes referred as Load Disaggregation, is the process of determining what loads are running on a house by analyzing the power signal of the whole house power meter. This example shows how a sequential neural network called Bidirectional LSTM performs in the load disaggregation with focus on the regression of the energy consumed by the always On load.
